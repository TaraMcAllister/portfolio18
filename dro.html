<h3>The Challenge</h3>

<p><a href="http://mrmurphy.com/">Chris Murphy</a> took our class for a Micropublications Workshop. The aim of the workshop was to create a product using collaborative ideation techniques and creativity. Product Design was the ultimate aim; a product that could exist in the market. We had to come up with the idea and then make it into fruition. Our final outcome would need to be market place ready. It could be a marketing poster or an app prototype: it was up to us.</p>

<h3>Collaborative Ideation</h3>
<p>Working as a team we had to use a Venn Diagram of three factors of Content Delivery. We would then randomly choose one word from each circle and create a product based of the words. This system allowed for unconstrained unique product ideas and pushed our limits. The Venn Diagram shows the 3 main factors.</p>

<div class="venn">
<img src="images/venndiagram.png" alt="venn diagram showing content, platform and frequency" class="vennimg">
</div>

<p>My team (Dan, Meghan, Glen and I) ended up with our favourite idea featuring the friends as content, special occasions as frequency and drones as our platform.</p>
<p>We came up the idea of 'ParcelPal' a drone that would deliver a gift to your loved one on Valentine's Day - it would even play a song! (Cue flashbacks to the movie "Say Anything" but set in 2059 not 1989.)</p>

<h3>Market Research</h3>

<p>What solutions for this problem are there already out there? I decided to do some market research and see what solutions other people have came up with and improve upon them.</p>

<div class="market">

<div class="primeair">
<h5>Prime Air</h5>

<p>Prime Air is the most well-known example of a Drone Delivery System although it is not widely available. Amazon started work on Prime Air as early as 2012.</p>

<p>Amazon Prime Air is a service (still in testing) that will deliver packages up to five pounds in 30 minutes or less using small drones.</p>

<p>One possible fallback of Amazon’s Prime Air is the need for the user to have an Amazon-branded landing mat which acts as a homing-beacon of sorts for the drone.</p>

<p>Another fallback of Amazon's drones is that they are so complicated, they have “detect and avoid” systems in order to avoid hazards such as children with big sticks trying to hit the drones down and take the package (yes, really.)</p>

<h5>aha</h5>

<p>Iceland are already bounds and leaps ahead of the rest of us, as usual. Forget having a Deliveroo cyclist come to your door, they have drones delivering fast food and groceries. Icelandic Start-up Aha has made drone deliveries a reality by simplifying the system and focusing just on Reykjavik.</p>

<p>It’s a world’s first, and one that flouts the standard aviation safety mantras. These drones don’t sense and avoid ­obstacles (like Prime Air will)—in fact, they don’t even have cameras, radar, or any other imaging systems. They fly according to GPS coordinates, along routes certified free of trees, buildings, and other impediments.</p>

<p>Part of Aha’s success is down to it’s location, Iceland allow the drones to fly on pre-agreed routes, however the FDA in America is sticking to its sense-and-avoid requirement - possibly holding Prime Air back.</p>

<p><b>Reflection:</b> From my market research I knew I wanted my delivery system to be fast, cheap and simple. I love the simplicity of aha's system and think it is the way forward.</p>

<h3>Thinking About Humans</h3>

<p>I did some research using information and data that already exists to see how useful a drone delivery gift system would be to my target audience. I considered who my target audeince would be; how useful would my system to people of varying ages, ability and genders. I want to do more research into these factors in order to build around these and find the medium my delivery system should take.</p>

<ul>
    <li>1 in 3 men have forgot about their anniversary.</li>
    <li>74% of Millenials and Generation Z interact with others digitally most often.</li>
    <li>69.5% of Millenials and Generation Z said they can imagine a future where all purchases are made online.</li>
    <li>Three in four Millenials say online shopping is preferable as it’s ”easier than going to the shops”.</li>
    <li>39 percent of U.S. consumers planned to purchase experiential gifts for Christmas 2017.</li>
    <li>80% of UK consumers look online for gifts at Christmas - 35% of these people say they use a tablet or smartphone.</li>
</uL>

<p>I chose to focus heavily on the element of forgetting important dates (something that I know many, many people do - and pay the price for) as well as Millenials and Generation Z as they are what is known as "early adopters" - meaning they will buy into new concepts and ideas before Generation X or Baby Boomers would. They are also the generations most likely to rely heavily on their mobiles. This makes them the perfect target market.</p>
<p>From this research I can see that having reminders of the dates and to buy gifts will be extremely helpful, that an native app is the best form for the drone delivery system to take. With 39% of U.S. consumers buying experiental gifts (and this number expected to rise as Gen Z get older and have more income) I think Dro could flourish in the market. A drone delivering a tangiable present is experiental in itself.</p>
<p>I found it quite difficult to find a lot of solid research on items such as how often people forget important dates or how many people think drones will be a big part of the future. Not much research has been done on other areas I wanted to explore more, so I shall have to do my own.</p>

<h3>Quantative Surveys</h3>

<p>I conducted surveys with target audience: Gen Y and Z. I had 5 Gen Z and 5 Gen Y fill out a survey to discover some important factors that would influence my product. These factors include: how they view drones, their forgetfulness, how they like to pay when shopping online and their gift buying habits. Given opportunity I would do more interviews and expand this to many more people.</p>

<h3>Creating a Brand</h3>

<p>Now that I had a firm idea of what I wanted my drone delivery system to become I decided to start building a brand, hence the style would be cohesive with the app UI. I wanted to create a name and a brand for my app. I have decided following user interviews and research that millenials, my target audience will engage most heavily with an online shopping app.</p>

<h3>Sketches</h3>

<h3>Trial and Error</h3>

<p>Dro's brand went through many iterations before reaching it's final design. At first I wanted to try a wordmark as the staple however I decided that they just didn't come across right digitally. I then moved into a more realistic illustration style, creating a box that I was then going to add propellers to, as a metaphor for what Dro does.</p>

<h3>Final Brand: Dro</h3>

<p>After reconsidering where I was taking Dro and remember to think about humans aka my target market. I wanted to refocus on minimalism and simplictity. I started with Dro's typeface. Experimenting with a few of my personal favourite fonts I decided that 'Brown' was the best fit for my minimalist wordmark. I chose to experiment with my own personal favourites as this was a passion project and I wanted a bit more of me in there.</p>
  
<p>When creating a colour palette for my brand I looked at colour psychology. I love designing with psychology in mind. Different colours make the human brain feel and think differently. I eventually choose orange, blue and purple as they reflect on the brand values. Orange represents confidence and friendliness, something I want Dro to be seen as; your friend that helps you deliver the best gifts to your loved ones. Blue represents trust, dependability and strength. These are all features that are very important for a deliver service to possess. Purple represents creativity. Purple is also my favourite colour. The whole idea of Dro is creative and trendsetting, and as purple is my favourite colour it also throws a bit more of me into my passion project.</p>

<p>I went back to my original skethes. I wanted to use a stronger visual of a drone in the brand so that it really hit home what Dro did. I took my sketch into Adobe Illustrator and using my colour palette created a modern style illsutration of a drone.</p>

<h3>User Flow</h3>

<p>After creating a brand for my app it was now back time to focus on the UX. I pinpointed main user activities and tasks for the gift buyer, creating a user flow using post-it notes.</p>

<h3>Sketches and Low-fidelity Prototyping</h3>

<p>After doing some research and discovery of other shopping apps and minimalist UI in general I started sketching some low-fi prototypes and getting my ideas down on paper.</p>

<div class="uipages">

<img src="images/sketches/ui2.jpg" class="right" id="uisketch">
</div>

<h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>

<p>After sketching the low-fidelity prototypes, I performed a heuristic evaluation. I made several important improvements, including:

<ul>
    <li>Decreased the number of upcoming events that would be in the background of the initial screen to avoid overloading the user with visual information.</li>
    <li>Added more drone imagery as that is Dro's USP.</li>
    <li>Decided to add a 'Create' button to the initial screen so Dro was not reliant on pulling the anniversaries, birthdays etc from another party. Many users, especially our target audience's older relatives may not have their data on other websites such as Facebook so it is important that they can add custom events.</li>
    <li>Rounded all buttons in order to increase style consistency.</li>
</ul>

<h3>High-fidelity Prototypes</h3>

<p>As I continued my research and development, I moved to high-fidelity prototypes and went through various design iterations.</p>

<h3>Reflection</h3>

<p>Reflecting on this project I am very happy with the final outcome and how I pushed myself to create a human-centred UI and delve deep into research. Given more time I would create more functionality and screens including the screen for creating an account and pulling the event information from Facebook. I would also carry out more research, possibly user interviews and a larger number of people completing the Quanatiative Surveys. In terms of UX  I would carry out UX tests on the app prototype and the delivery system as a whole.</p>
